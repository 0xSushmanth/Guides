!!! tip ""
    Keep in mind the path are setup so it works with hardlinks and instant moves.

!!! attention ""
    The default path setup used by [Linux|Server.io](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} don't support hardlinks and instant moves, but you're able to change this, by not using the pre-defined paths like:

    - `/downloads` => `/data/downloads`
    - `/movies` => `/data/media/movies`
    - `/tv` => `/data/media/tv`.
