# TRaSH-Guides

*TRaSH Guides, Guides that aren't trash.*

Here you will find Guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it.

## How this all started

When starting to use Sonarr/Radarr I noticed it didn't get exactly the release I actually wanted being I'm a bit picky about what release & quality I prefer.

So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred, On discord I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being I had to explain it often I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when  they needed it.
After a while I also decided to create guides for often asked questions on discord, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from different sources.
The guides I make I try to make them as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more then just some text.

### DISCLAIMER

The information I use for the guides is information I gathered from different sources like their support forum, Reddit or Discord, Provided by user input or from the develop team it self.
Most things I tested myself and tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others.
